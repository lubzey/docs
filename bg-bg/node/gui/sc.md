# Interacting with Smart Contracts

## Multi-party signed address

Multi-party signed address is a contract address that requires one or more parties to sign during the process of transaction.

To create a multi-party signed address:

1. From NEO-GUI, right-click on the account area and select `Create Contract Address` -> `Multi-Signature`.

2. In the public key list, enter the public keys used for signing.

3. Specify the minimal number of signatures.

## Deploying and invoking smart contracts

For the smart contracts you have compiled, you can depoy and invoke them in the NEO blockchain using NEO-GUI. For more information, refer to [deploying and invoking smart contracts](../../sc/quickstart/deploy-invoke.md).
