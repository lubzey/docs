# API Reference

Each node in the Neo-CLI provides an API interface for obtaining blockchain data from a node, making it easy to develop blockchain applications. The interface is provided via [JSON-RPC](http://wiki.geekdream.com/Specification/json-rpc_2.0.html), and the underlying protocol uses HTTP/HTTPS for communication.
